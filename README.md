# Dice Duel Game 

A browser-based dice duel game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

Dice-Duel-game is a modern, visual upgrade inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann’s Pig Game. This version expands on the original concept with a fully responsive layout, extensive custom styling, and a 3D dice system featuring random spin and roll animations. Additionally, immersive audio cues—such as dice roll sound effects and player-switch feedback—enhance the overall gameplay experience and make interactions feel more dynamic and polished.

## Features

- Responsive, mobile-friendly UI
- Fully customized CSS design
- 3D dice with randomized spin + roll animations
- Audio feedback (dice roll, player change, and more) for improved immersion
- Lightweight and framework-free

## How to play  


1. Open the game in any modern browser.

2. Press the Roll button to animate the 3D dice with sound effects for greater feedback.

3. Your roll is added to your current turn score.

4. You may choose to Roll again to accumulate more points or Hold to bank your current turn score.

5. If you roll a 1, your current turn score is lost and the turn automatically switches to the other player.

6. Turns alternate as each player rolls, holds, and builds their total score.

7. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
